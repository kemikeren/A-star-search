# A-star search
 
Greatly inspired by Mathematician Kristian Edlund, I decided to work my way through Project Euler exercise #83 that's about finding the minimal path in a 80X80 grid such that when adding the matrix elements together, the least sum is attained. I utilized an A-star algorithm for this.
